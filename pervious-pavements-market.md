<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Pavements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pervious pavements market is categorized into two primary types: powder and liquid. Powdered solutions, like porous cement or asphalt mixtures, are designed to allow water infiltration while maintaining structural integrity. These materials typically incorporate aggregates that create voids for drainage. Liquid solutions, on the other hand, include sealants or coatings that enhance permeability and durability. They are applied to existing surfaces or incorporated into the pavement construction process to improve water management and reduce runoff. Both types contribute significantly to sustainable urban development.</p></p>
