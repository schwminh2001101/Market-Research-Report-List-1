<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zener Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole Technology</li><li>Surface Mount Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zener diodes are vital components in voltage regulation and reference applications, and their market is divided into two primary types: Through Hole Technology (THT) and Surface Mount Technology (SMT). THT involves mounting diodes on printed circuit boards (PCBs) with leads that go through holes, offering robustness and ease of handling. In contrast, SMT allows for compact design by positioning diodes directly on the surface of PCBs, facilitating higher circuit densities and automated assembly, thus catering to modern electronic device demands.</p></p>
