Nevertheless, the brand recognizes that traditional bulbs retain a niche market and continues to sell them alongside its LED offerings. Philips’ total revenue exceeds €19 billion, but like GE, exact incandescent sales are not separately quantified.</p><p>**Osram GmbH** is another significant player, investing heavily in future-proof technologies. Though traditional incandescent sales are diminishing, Osram maintains a diverse product portfolio. The company reported revenues of around €3.5 billion, part of which includes legacy lighting products.</p><p>**Crompton Greaves** and **Havells India** have also sustained their market presence, focusing on regional preferences while adapting to consumer demands for energy efficiency. </p><p>The overall market is expected to decline due to stringent regulations and growing consumer adoption of LED lighting, which poses challenges for traditional bulb manufacturers. However, niche demand in certain markets ensures that these companies will remain active players in this segment for the foreseeable future.</p></p>

<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Traditional Incandescent Bulbs Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>The traditional incandescent bulb market has experienced significant decline due to the rise of energy-efficient alternatives like LED and CFL bulbs. Regulatory measures in many countries promoting energy efficiency have accelerated this trend. In 2023, the market is estimated to shrink further, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -5% as consumers increasingly opt for sustainable lighting solutions. However, niche markets for vintage and decorative incandescent bulbs may experience modest growth. Moving forward, the market outlook leans towards residual demand driven by nostalgia and specific applications, but overall penetration will continue to diminish as energy standards tighten globally.</p></p>
